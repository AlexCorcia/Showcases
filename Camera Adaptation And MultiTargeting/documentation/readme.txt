Project Name: 
Camera Obstacle Avoidance and Multiple Targeting

Summary:
The simulation will show how the camera that I implemented is able to avoid obstacles that set
themselfs between the target and the camera and also how it handles multitargeting.


********** Controls: **********
If you have no targets or no target selected the camera can be moved manually:

Hold right click to control it.

W -> FORWARD
S -> BACK
A -> LEFT
D -> RIGHT
Q -> UP
E -> DOWN

Mouse for the target of the camera

Everything else is pretty self-explanatory


You will start in No Targeting, if you want to try the Obstacle Avoidance, 
select the Single target and click on an object, and for the mutiple targeting on the 
multi target.

Once you are in a scene you can add obstacles and modifie them by clicking on them. 
Same for  the entities.

Entities will count as targets and obstacles wont.
(For the multitargeting.)


Also you are not able to delete objects, had a little issue with that, i had to remove it.
